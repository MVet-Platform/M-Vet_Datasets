# M-Vet_Hackathon24

This repository contains resources for the [M-Vet Livestock Project](https://www.m-vet.net/) hackathon.  
The Hackathon is running from **20st August 2024** to **26th August 2024** .  
The competition will focus on building computer vision models for Animal type detection and Body score prediction.

### [Challenge 1: Animal Type detection](https://github.com/MVet-Platform/M-Vet_Hackathon24/tree/animal_type_detection_dataset)

Participants will develop models to predict the types of animals in an image. Animal classes include cow, goat and pig.

### [Challenge 2: Body score prediction](https://github.com/MVet-Platform/M-Vet_Hackathon24/tree/body_scores_prediction_dataset)

Participants will develop models to predict the body score of an animal given an image of the animal. The range of possible values for body score is from 1 to 5

### [Code Submissions](https://github.com/MVet-Platform/M-Vet_Hackathon24/tree/main/code)

#### Note:

All necessary resources are available in other branches of this repository. Resources for body score prediction can be found in **body_score_prediction_dataset** branch while those for animal type detection can be found in **animal_type_detection** branch
