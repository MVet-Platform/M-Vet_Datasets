# M-Vet_Hackathon24

This repository contains resources for the [Makerere Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://air.ug/) Computer Vision for agriculture Hackathon.  
The Hackathon is running from start date to end date .  
The competition will focus on building computer vision models for Well Identification & Measurement Prediction and Animal posture prediction.  
Through this, university students will gain experience in building solutions for deployment in the field.

## The problem

The task is to develop 2 computer vision models for object detection tasks.

### Animal Posture Detection

Participants will develop models to predict the posture of an animal. LPossible labels include Front, Rear, Left and Right.
