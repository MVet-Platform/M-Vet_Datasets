# M-Vet_Hackathon24

This repository contains resources for the [Makerere Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://air.ug/) Computer Vision for agriculture Hackathon.  
The Hackathon is running from **tdb** to **tdb** .  
The competition will focus on building computer vision models for Animal type detection and Body score prediction.

### Animal Type detection

Participants will develop models to predict the types of animals in an image. Animal classes include cow, goat and pig.

### Body score prediction

Participants will develop models to predict the body score of an animal given an image of the animal. The range of possible values for body score is from 1 to 5

#### Note:

All necessary resources are available in other branches of this repository. Resources for body score prediction can be found in **body_score_prediction_dataset** branch while those for animal type detection can be found in **animal_type_detection** branch
